# K-Means Clustering
Clustering is an unsupepervised learning method in which we form the dataset into cluster of items or group of items on the basis of similarity or dissimilarity between the items or objects. In other words, we form groups several groups of items or objects such that each group has its the similar items/objects while rest of the items which are dissimilar are in some other group. In an unsupervised method, we are not given any pre defined labels and we have to infer the given dataset to form labelled sets. Same is being done here. We will not be given any predefined label and we have to label our clusters in such a way that all similar objects should be toegther in each cluster and the data point from different cluster should be as different as possible.

Here, I will be trying to explain the most basic and important clustering algorithm called K Means clustering Algorithm.

## What is K Means Clustering Algorithm
K-means is a clustering algorithm which is centroid-based where we find the distance between the cluster centers and different points/objects. We assign a particular point/object to that cluster with which the distance the between point and cluster center is minimum. In K-Means, each cluster is represented by a centroid or the cluster mean.
